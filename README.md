# PROJECT_IITG
  This repository showcases all the hands-on projects undertaken throughout my minor degree program at IIT Guwahati.

## 📚 Book Comparison Project
  🎯 Overview
      An elegant text analysis project that explores the fascinating relationships between 64 literary works. Using sophisticated comparison algorithms, this project uncovers hidden patterns and similarities in classic literature.

## ✨ Key Features
Identifies the 100 most influential words across the literary corpus <br/>
Generates a comprehensive 64x64 similarity matrix <br/>
Reveals the top 10 most closely related book pairs <br/>
Processes and analyzes raw text with precision <br/>
Implements robust comparison algorithms <br/>

## 📊 Results Highlight
Our analysis revealed some fascinating connections between books. Here are some notable findings:<br/>

Gerard's Herbal volumes show remarkable similarity (91% match between Vol. 3 and Vol. 4)<br/>
Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington demonstrates strong narrative consistency across volumes<br/>
Foxes Book of Martyrs maintains thematic coherence throughout different parts<br/>

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
Core Components<br/>
Custom Book class for efficient text representation<br/>
Advanced text preprocessing pipeline<br/>
Sophisticated similarity calculation algorithms<br/>
Comprehensive word frequency analysis<br/>
Technology Stack<br/><br/>
Language: C++<br/><br/>
Data Format: Raw text files<br/>
Analysis Method: Statistical text comparison<br/>

## 📈 Performance
The program efficiently processes 64 books and performs:<br/>

Word frequency analysis across entire corpus<br/>
2,016 unique book-to-book comparisons<br/>
Similarity ranking and sorting<br/>

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository<br/>
Ensure all book text files are in the designated directory<br/>
Compile the C++ source files<br/>
Run the executable<br/>
Find results in the output directory<br/>

## 📝 Output Files

The program generates several output files:<br/>

common_words.txt: Top 100 most frequent words.<br/>
similarity_matrix.txt: Complete comparison matrix.<br/>
similar_books.txt: Top 10 most similar book pairs.<br/>

## 🔍 Future Scope

Natural Language Processing integration.<br/>
Interactive visualization dashboard.<br/>
Semantic analysis capabilities.<br/>
Genre classification features.<br/>
Multi-language support.<br/>

## 💡 Technical Note

The current implementation uses a single-threaded approach to ensure maximum stability and reliability. While this design choice impacts processing speed, it guarantees consistent results across all system configurations.
